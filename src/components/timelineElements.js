    description: "As you know, we met on a plane to Fiji. Might be the luckiest thing ever that we met on a plane and we didn’t have a third person on our row. We talked for ages and straight away I knew we were going to get along well like out chats were so good and we had so many things in common. I can believe we talked so late in the night and it just kept going was so funny. I was also instantly attracted to you. There wasn't too much flirt going on but definitely a connection between us. I did forget your name and had to have a peek at your passport later so I could remember and even get anna to tell me. There was a bit of awkwardness at the big airport where it was me, you, Mason and Marissa, but I wanted to stay with you guys instead of going to talk with Maggie and Anna. I was also talking to Anna and Maggie about you kind of already…."

    description: "During Fiji was so much fun. This is gonna be a long message. At the start I was crushing on you so hard, I tried so hard to think of ways to hang out and I am so glad Maggie and Anna decided to let you guys 'join' us. I was getting friend vibes at the start from you and I didn't wanna be weird cause everyone was just being friendly and I felt if I tried to make a move it might make me look weird. So I waited and kept talking to Anna and Maggie about it. Eventually I kind of gave up because of reasons and then just kept hanging out though and then finally we were both drunk and it all started. The self constraint I had was crazy to not go to yours that night when you invited me, I am so glad I didn't though because it has turned out so well. The next night was great we were smart to use the game of spit to our advantage to be alone with each other. Then finally you made a move and then I made a move. To this day I am still so confused how me going for the kiss caught you off guard, like was that not expected after that long conversation about our feelings? Never mind. ",

    description: "Then that week was awesome, even though we both were zombies from sleep deprivation, I had so much fun with you and didn't want Fiji to come to an end. It did eventually and you said we might have to be friends but I knew that wasn't going to happen. Our goodbye at the airport was very platonic as your dad was there so couldn't say much, well we did not actually even acknowledge each other. But reflecting, I made 0 friends on that trip but I got myself a girlfriend. I would never have predicted it because my intention was to purely just make as many friends as possible but once you chained me I was unable to. We still had an amazing time and I loved spending that with you. I then didn't know what to message you since we left the airport but it worked so can't stress, I really wanted to see you straight away but decided to hold back and take it slow."

    description: "This should probably be split into two but oh well. We had our Philip island trip planned but unfortunately I was too sick, I didn't' realise you had no idea how sick I was and started to think I was a 'moment of fulfillment'. I should've communicated more, but once I was in the hospital I talked to you so much if it were not for you I would have been so bored and I am so grateful for you in that period of time. Then I eventually was freed from jail on Tuesday the 13th, I really wanted to see you so we made plans for valentines day and it was a great coincidence because I wanted to get you flowers and valentines day gave me a good excuse to. My parents were not too happy I was spending the night at some random girls place  the day after I left ICU, but nonetheless it was amazing and our first official date at that Thai restaurant.  Then after this we decided to actually re do the Philip island trip and I loved going away with you and I look forward to so many more trips with you in the future, especially studying abroad together."

    description: "We had a very good start to our dating phase I think. I am so grateful I got sick because you mentioned it made you like me more, and if I had of gotten surgery that early we probably would not be where we are right now. I loved learning everything about you, your hobbies, your strong environmental and political opinions and aspirations, your constant selflessness towards me, and of course, your independence. You have an amazing independence that not many people have especially with around the house stuff and living in general. Sometimes there are moments were I may not suggest this… (almost getting lost in Ringwood when your phone died). It was awesome to meet your family even though I saw very little of your mum she left a good impression on me, your dad is so nice, sometimes quiet but that’s just him. And your sister is also great, she is so different from you personality wise and it is so funny but I love that about you guys, you are so different but get along and function so well (most the time). I'll be honest, at the start I didn't know if you would be able to match my level of banter as you are a more serious and less childish person compared to me, but I was wrong."

Your friends were all amazing and I loved spending drunk time with you, for some reason I got jealous on the dance floor because you were having so much fun with everyone else but it was so nice to see you have so much fun. Unfortunately I went home alone this night…. Regardless was so much fun and was very good night to meet most your mates and even your work mate!"

In hindsight I didn't need to but that doesn’t matter. I wanted to make it nice and romantical but in the end I just asked you on a walk. And my heart sank, after I asked you, you said 'but I am basically already your girlfriend' and I thought you were gonna say something bad. Anyways I asked you and I am so grateful for you, I love you so much and so happy and extremely lucky to have you as my girlfriend."

Like when we were at smiths beach on your long board where there was barely anyone but really small waves, that was probably a top 3 surf of all time for me because it was so much fun with you. Unfortunately we haven't had much opportunities lately cause of my shoulder but can't wait to go back. I would even love to go out with you and just watch while you surf."

We both had pres at different places where you was with Abbey, Kate and Jordan and I was with Milo, Henry, Harley. We spent the night floating between each other and our friends, you even met Joe and Gian that night which is also a bonus! However, another night where I went home alone…."

It is always nice and wholesome sitting on the couch or in my bed when I have you sleeping next to me and I am studying. I have the girl I love next to me while doing the thing I love (if it's not commerce units). I love that we are able to just chillout and study together or just lie down sometimes instead of always doing activities like I used to think a relationship would be."

We had a lot of fun and it was very nice doing a day trip with you. We got some great pictures of each other (just of you tbh) and I can't wait for our trip away during the mid semester break as it might give similar vibes to this one."

This did eventually go away once we started our fun activities in the jungle and go to the beach but there was never a day where it dawned on me I was so far away from you. We texted every day and I called you as much as I possibly could. I think us texting everyday did make it much worse, but it also strengthen our relationship and we communicated extremely well and I am so proud of us. "

After this my flight to Bangkok was an hour and a half and then I had to wait 6 hours for my flight home. So I finally got home 36 hours after that long process and the whole time I was thinking about seeing you. I had a big dilemma though, to hug you or mum first. I hugged mum. Shows a lot doesn't it. Anyways we had a great day of catching up and it was very short lived because of my surgery. I was not looking forward to this at all, it meant I just got home from not seeing you, to barely being able to see you. I wish I never had to have it done."

I love you so much and these weeks have been amazing. Your constant want to see me has me so shocked since I have been semi disabled and unable to do anything and I love that about you."

Study abroad is something I have wanted to do since year 11 and I am so lucky that I get to go with you it will be one of the highlights of my life. I feel like we are still in the honeymoon phase and it will not ever end, we communicate so well which is 100% due to your initiatives at the start of the relationship which means we never fight. I love spending time with you and I love our banter that we have. I am somewhat obsessed with you and can't wait for more. I love you so much Fleur and I am the luckiest person to be able to have you as my girlfriend."
